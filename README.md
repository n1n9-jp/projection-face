We've all seen the projected head from [Elements of map projection with applications to map and chart construction](https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003898271#page/n58/mode/1up), but the authors in 1921 did not have D3 to help them show a full range of weird distorted faces. This is based on the [Map Projection Transitions](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/transition/) example by Jason Davies.
